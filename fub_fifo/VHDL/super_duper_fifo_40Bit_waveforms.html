<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file super_duper_fifo_40Bit.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design super_duper_fifo_40Bit.vhd.  The design super_duper_fifo_40Bit.vhd has a depth of 16 words of 40 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in legacy synchronous mode.  The data becomes available after 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read request. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design for FIFO full condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
