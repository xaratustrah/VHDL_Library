<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file pll0.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of altpll megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design pll0.vhd. The design pll0.vhd has Cyclone AUTO pll configured in NORMAL mode The primary clock input to the PLL is INCLK0, with clock period 20000 ps. CLK0 multiply by = 5, CLK0 divide by = 2, CLK0 phase_shift = 0 CLK1 multiply by = 4, CLK1 divide by = 1, CLK1 phase_shift = 0 Output port LOCKED is used. This port will go high when the PLL locks to the input clock. </P>
